# means-of-transport

**A hopeless attempt to standardise means of (public & private) transport identifiers.** Created to be used by the [*Friendly Public Transport Format*](https://github.com/public-transport/friendly-public-transport-format#friendly-public-transport-format-fptf), dedicated to @juliuste's urge to sort them.
